THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

1. Definitions

   1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
   2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
   3. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
   4. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
   5. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
   6. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
   7. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
   8. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
   9. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
   4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
   5.

      For the avoidance of doubt:
         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

來源： 摘錄自 "LICENSE.txt" 文件，內容為 Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) 授權條款。

摘要：

本文件詳細闡述了 Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported 授權條款（下稱「本授權條款」）的條款與條件。此授權條款旨在規範使用者（下稱「您」）對受版權保護的「作品」（下稱「作品」）的使用權利。本授權條款授予使用者廣泛的權利，允許其以多種方式使用作品，但同時也附加了特定的限制與義務，最核心的要求是必須對原作者進行歸屬。

主要主題和重要概念：

授權的性質：
本授權條款是一種公共授權，旨在促進作品的自由使用和傳播。
「藉由行使這裡提供的作品的任何權利，您接受並同意受本授權條款的條款約束。」這表明使用者必須接受並遵守授權條款的條件才能行使權利。
授權是「全球性、免版稅、非專屬、永久性」的（持續期間為適用版權的存續期間），這意味著在全球範圍內都有效，無需支付版稅，授權人可以將作品授權給多人，並且在版權有效期內持續有效。
定義：
本授權條款提供了多個關鍵術語的定義，以確保對條款的準確理解。重要的定義包括：
「改編」 (Adaptation)： 指基於作品或作品與其他既有作品衍生的作品，例如翻譯、改編、衍生作品等。
「集合著作」(Collection)： 指文學或藝術作品的集合，例如百科全書或選集，其中作品以未經修改的完整形式包含在內。請注意，「集合著作」不被視為「改編」。
「散布」(Distribute)： 指透過銷售或其他所有權轉讓方式，向公眾提供作品或改編的原始及副本。
「授權人」(Licensor)： 指依本授權條款提供作品的個人或實體。
「原作者」(Original Author)： 指創作文學或藝術作品的個人或實體，或其他特定類型作品的相應創造者（如表演者、製作人）。
「作品」(Work)： 包含廣泛的文學和藝術作品，涵蓋書籍、演講、戲劇、音樂作品、電影、視覺藝術、表演、廣播、錄音、數據彙編等各種形式。
「您」(You)： 指依本授權條款行使權利，且先前未違反本授權條款，或已獲得授權人明確許可的使用者。
「公開演出」(Publicly Perform)： 指向公眾表演作品，包括公開朗誦、數位表演、廣播等。
「重製」(Reproduce)： 指透過任何方式製作作品的副本，包括錄音或錄影。
授權授予的權利：
授權人授予使用者以下權利：
「重製作品，將作品納入一個或多個集合著作，並重製作為集合著作一部分的作品。」
「建立和重製改編，前提是任何此類改編，包括任何媒介的翻譯，應採取合理步驟清楚標示、劃分或以其他方式識別已對原始作品進行了更改。」例如，翻譯應標明「原始作品從英文翻譯成西班牙文」，修改應標明「原始作品已修改」。
「散布和公開演出作品，包括作為集合著作一部分的作品。」
「散布和公開演出改編。」
授權權利可在現有或未來開發的所有媒體和格式中行使。
授權人保留所有未明確授予的權利。
限制：
授權權利受到以下限制：
必須在相同的授權條款下散布或公開演出： 「您只能根據本授權條款的條款散布或公開演出作品。」必須隨作品副本提供本授權條款的副本或 URI。
不得施加額外限制： 「您不得對作品施加任何限制本授權條款條款或作品接收者依本授權條款行使權利的條款。」
不得再授權 (sublicense)。
必須保留所有相關通知： 必須保留所有提及本授權條款和免責聲明的通知。
不得施加有效的技術措施： 您不能對作品施加有效的技術措施，以限制作品接收者依本授權條款行使權利的能力。
歸屬要求： 「如果您散布或公開演出作品或任何改編或集合著作，您必須保留作品的所有版權通知，並提供（根據您使用的媒介或方式的合理程度）：(i) 原作者的姓名（如果提供）和/或授權人或原作者指定的歸屬方名稱；(ii) 作品的標題（如果提供）；(iii) 在合理可行的範圍內，授權人指定與作品相關的 URI（如果提供）；(iv) 在改編的情況下，提供標明在改編中使用作品的歸屬（例如，『由原作者翻譯的法文版本』）。」歸屬必須以合理的方式實施，在改編或集合著作中，歸屬至少應與其他貢獻者的歸屬一樣顯著。您只能將此歸屬用於歸屬目的，不得暗示與原作者、授權人或歸屬方有任何聯繫、贊助或認可。
不得進行誹謗性行為： 除另有書面同意或適用法律允許外，您不得歪曲、篡改、修改或採取其他可能損害原作者名譽或榮譽的誹謗性行為。授權人同意在某些司法管轄區（例如日本），如果改編權的行使會被視為誹謗性行為，授權人將在適用法律允許的最大範圍內放棄或不行使此條款，以使您能夠合理行使改編權。
聲明、保證和免責聲明：
「除非雙方另有書面約定，授權人按『現狀』提供作品，對作品不作任何形式的陳述或保證，無論是明示、暗示、法定或其他，包括但不限於所有權、適銷性、特定用途的適用性、非侵權性、或是否存在潛在或其他缺陷、準確性、或是否存在錯誤，無論是否可發現。」
授權人明確否認任何關於作品的保證。
責任限制：
「除適用法律要求外，在任何情況下，授權人均不對您承擔因本授權條款或使用作品而產生的任何特殊、附帶、間接、懲罰性或懲戒性損害賠償責任，即使授權人已被告知可能發生此類損害。」
終止：
「本授權條款及此處授予的權利將在您違反本授權條款的條款時自動終止。」
從您處獲得改編或集合著作的個人或實體的授權將不會終止，前提是他們完全遵守其授權。
授權權利是永久性的（在適用版權的存續期間內）。
授權人保留以不同授權條款發布作品或隨時停止散布作品的權利，但這不會撤回已根據本授權條款授予的授權。
其他條款：
每次您散布或公開演出作品或集合著作時，授權人向接收者提供與授予您相同的授權條款下的作品授權。
每次您散布或公開演出改編時，授權人向接收者提供與授予您相同的授權條款下的原始作品授權。
如果本授權條款的任何規定根據適用法律無效或不可執行，其餘條款的有效性或可執行性不受影響。
對本授權條款的棄權或同意任何違約行為必須以書面形式進行並由相關方簽署。
本授權條款構成雙方關於授權作品的完整協議。
本授權條款參考了多個國際版權條約（如伯爾尼公約、羅馬公約等）的術語和原則。
最重要的想法或事實：

CC BY 3.0 授權條款允許對作品進行重製、散布、公開演出和改編，但核心要求是 必須進行歸屬。
使用者必須遵守授權條款的所有條件才能合法使用作品。
授權人提供作品時不提供任何擔保，並限制其責任。
違反授權條款會導致授權自動終止。
歸屬要求是本授權條款中最關鍵的義務之一。
「改編」與「集合著作」在授權條款中有明確區分，對其使用有不同的要求。
總結：

本文件詳盡說明了 Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported 授權條款的條款與條件，核心在於平衡版權保護與促進作品的自由使用。授權人允許使用者在進行歸屬的前提下廣泛使用作品，包括重製、散布、公開演出和建立改編。同時，授權條款明確了使用者的義務和授權人的責任限制。理解這些條款對於合法使用依據此授權條款發布的作品至關重要。
